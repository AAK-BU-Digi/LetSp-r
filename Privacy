**1. Data Collection and Use:**

The Extension primarily functions to block access to specified websites based on lists retrieved from publicly accessible CSV files. The Extension does not directly collect personal or sensitive user data.

* **Website Blocking Lists:** The Extension retrieves website blocking lists from CSV files hosted at URLs configured through Google Admin console. These CSV files are publicly accessible and do not contain personal user data.

The Extension does not store personal or sensitive user data locally or remotely. Configuration data is stored and managed through Google Admin console.

**3. Data Sharing:**
